        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p> 
            Hi! We're Sam and Naomi. We are both 7th graders at GMS. We made these products because 
            they help make your surroundings more calming. Our  help enrich your reading 
            time! We recognize that reading time is personal and relaxing. 
            Both bookmarks and Twinkle Lights come in variety to personalize and add to
            your reading experience!
        </p>   
        <h3>Introducing...</h3>
        <p>
            Naomi is a voracious reader. She also loves snacks, which often leads to a combination of 
            snacking and reading, which, as you can guess, rarely turns out well. She also plays piano and does
            taekwondo. She has a little brother, who can be nice on some days, and absolutely ... difficult 
            on other days. 
        </p>  
        <p>
            Sam is a lover of reading and writing. They take an interest in building and dissecting worlds that come 
            from imagination. They'd like to help create a relaxing and 
            absorbing enviorment for any reader! Sam has a younger sibling, who they are ever thankful to for 
            being able to order at a resturant.
