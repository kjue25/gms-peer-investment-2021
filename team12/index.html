        <p>
            Our products are colorful and uniquely shaped laminated bookmarks. 
            There are many different types of fable-holders to match the story. 
            These bookmarks help keep your book in good condition, and they 
            help keep your book pages straight. Fable-Holders come in different 
            designs and colors. (Click the title to open the pictures!)

        <p>
            Twinkle Lights are origami creations strung on fairy lights. 
            They provide calming ambient light, perfect for a bedroom
            or study. Twinkle Lights are around 3'3 ft long and come in 
            different colors and designs. (Click the title to open the pictures!)

        <h3>Our Plans</h3>
       <p>  
            We are planning to sell the Twinkle Lights for 8-10 dollars and the Fable-Holders 
            for around 3 dollars. There would be 10 of each of the three Twinkle Light designs, 
            and also 10 of each of the three Fable-Holder designs. (So thirty Twinklies 
            and thirty Fable-Holders.)
