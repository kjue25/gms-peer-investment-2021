<p> Hi! Welcome to Cute Kawaii Crafts (CKC for short)! We make cute kawaii themed clay characters which is a good gift for a friend or a cute decoration. You should join our team because we're super nice and fun ;)) We will be making our figures out of polymer clay and using a blow-dryer to dry them. We have multiple different jobs if you don't want to make the figures (or dont have the time) you can come up with their names and/or their stories or you can work on packaging! It would be so fun to have YOU on our team! :) </p>
