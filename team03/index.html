    <img src="Whales7.jpeg" width=400>
    <p>this is a close-up of one of our many crocheted animals to come. our crocheted stuffed animals are soft, squishy, and even safe to throw at your little siblings/friends. who wouldn't want these cute stress relievers?</p>
    <p>currently, for a small animal (ex. the whale), it would cost around $8. for a bigger animal, it would be around $10.</p>

    <p>this is a picture of a white jellyfish. the top strand can be used to dangle the jellyfish from anything you want! (ex. bedframe, backpack, etc.)</p>
    <p>at the moment, we only have these cute crocheted whales, other underwater creatures, and a couple bees! we are working on getting new animals, items, and possibly even little key chains :)</p>
