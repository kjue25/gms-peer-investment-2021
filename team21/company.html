        Hello! Welcome to our Cloud Nine website! 
        Our team members are  Vivi, Livi, and Carina! 
        Our product is Cloud Lights. 
        The key values of our team are communication, 
        problem solving, speaking our ideas, and dividing 
        work evenly. We try really hard to uphold our values 
        while being kind, patient, and flexible with one 
        another. To first decide on our product, we accepted 
        others' ideas, while contributing our own, and we all 
        came to an agreement. We are expecting to make 
        profit, and we took our time with our cost of goods and other 
        pricing aspects of our company. 
        We have exceptional displays of our product 
        and had much interest based on our feedback forms. 
        Out of the 78 people who responded to our survey, 
        64% loved them, and 29% liked them. It does not take much time to make 
        our product. Our product is high quality and is beautiful. Thanks 
        for your consideration in voting for our team! 
        Remember every cloud has a silver lining.
