<h1> About Our Company: </h1>

<h2> Our Company Story:</h2>
<h4>Our company was started in 2021 by Jaya, Karuna, and Juliet. We’re all super close and are so excited to be working together. We incorporated everyone's ideas into our team, Juliet made the idea for our logo design, Jaya had the idea to have Scrub Hub be our name, and Karuna thought we should make our brand color a light pink. That’s just one example of how we work together, as there are so many more ways. We came together after our teams were disassembled for round 2, and we instantly clicked! Hope you love our products!</h4>
