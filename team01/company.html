    <h1 id="why">Why Morse Code Bracelets?</h1>

<p>
    We have decided to make morse code braclets because they are very unique. Our initial product was not going to be morse code braclets but when we found them we knew that we had to make them. These braclets are unique and special and are braclets that stand out from the rest. We hope you like our braclets!
