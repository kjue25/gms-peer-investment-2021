              <h3>How This Company Progressed</h3>  
              <p>We started this company on phase 1 of entre. We advertised rings, earrings, and mask necklaces. We got split up in round 2, and Shira joined us! We then formed Ellokey. We started with the earrings and keychains idea, then we learned how to code our own website. We made the name of our company: E for earrings and key for keychains to represent our company name. </p>
