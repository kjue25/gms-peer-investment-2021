    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p> Hi! We sell popsockets and stickers. We were orignally doing phone cases, but we realized that those products would be hard, because there are multiple phone types, sizes, and cameras. Our popsockets and stickers are fun and easy to make, coming from digital designs. Our team is comprised of Andrea C., Grace L., and Lucy I. </p>
<p>Here at Tacenda, we take our product very seriously, and we want to make something for you that you will enjoy! In our team, Grace does the designs, Lucy makes the website, and Andrea does pricing and makes the product. We are all very well suited for our jobs and enjoy working together. </p>
 <h2>Our Team</h2>
