        <p> Hi! We sell popsockets and stickers. We were orignally doing phone cases, but we realized that those products would be hard, because there are multiple phone types, sizes, and cameras. Our popsockets and stickers are fun and easy to make, coming from digital designs. Our team is comprised of Andrea C., Grace L., and Lucy I.</p>
