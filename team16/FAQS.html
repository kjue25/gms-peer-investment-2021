        <h2>How much do the wraps cost?</h2>
    <h3>We are selling them for around 6 dollars each (depending on the size) and there will probably be discounts on packs.</h3>
    <h2>How do you clean them?</h2>
    <h3>Our wraps can be easily cleaned with cold to warm water (hot water might melt the wax) and a washcloth. You just need to wipe them down and then they are ready to use again!</h3>
    <h2>Are they food safe?</h2>
    <h3>Yes. All of the ingredients are edible (though we donâ€™t recommend eating them) and your food is safe! However you cannot wash them with boiling water, so do not use them on raw meat.</h3>
    <h2>What are in them?</h2>
    <h3>Beeswax, jojoba oil, and pine resin.</h3>
    <h2>Do they have a smell?</h2>
    <h3>They do not have a particularly strong scent, but they do smell a little bit like honey (because of the beeswax) </h3>
    <h2>Are the bags sealable?</h2>
    <h3>Yes, they keep a pretty strong seal so your food won't fall out. However don't carry liquids in them (for obvious reasons)</h3>
    <h2>Do they stick to bowls well?</h2>
    <h3>Yes, you can lift a corner to check in a bowl without the whole thing coming off. </h3>
