<h1>Its a Wrap!</h1>
<h4>The end of using disposable plastic wraps</h4>

<p>Plastic and aluminum wraps can make a lot of waste, so instead, you can use beeswax wraps! They can be used in the same way as other, less planet-friendly products. Plus, they come in a lot of cool patterns, designs, and shapes. Our wrap is sticky enough to cover bowls, but not sticky enough to stick to you (and your food!). Since our beeswax wrap is made of the same as what goes into your lip balms, they are completely food safe. They can also be stored with your food in a fridge. They can be safely cleaned by being wiped down and rinsed with cold water.  Instead of filling the landfills, beeswax wraps are biodegradable so when one stops being as sticky (after about a year of use) you can compost it!
